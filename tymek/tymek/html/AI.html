    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

    <h2>AI Definition</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">Intelligence (AI)</a> refers to the development
of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
problem-solving, understanding natural language,
recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>
<img src="ai.webp">
<p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
and techniques, such as machine learning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">natural language processing</a>, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>

In relation to artificial intelligence,
the following key concepts can be distinguished:
<ol>
<li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
that allows systems to learn from data and improve
over time without being explicitly programmed.
Examples include recommendation systems (like
Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>

<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
and generate human language. Applications include voice
assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
translation systems.</li>

<li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.</li>

<li>Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>

<li>Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
diagnosis or financial decision-making.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>

<p>AI is used as voice assistants. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri" target="_blank">Siri</a>, Google Assistant,
and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
recommend products or shows based on your previous
interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
roads and make driving decisions.</p>

<h2>The Future of AI</h2>

<p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as
healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing.
However, ethical considerations, such as job
displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also
key topics of discussion. The development of AI is
likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily
life in the years to come.</p>

<p>The data in the table shows four main areas of AI application:
    natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning,
    and reinforcement learning. Each area is related to a specific application,
    such as chatbots, medical image analysis systems, or autonomous vehicles.
    These applications have a significant impact on various sectors,
    improving the efficiency of customer service, medical diagnostics,
    protection against financial fraud, and the development of modern
    technologies such as self-driving cars.</p>

<h2>Survey</h2>
<p>Here is a survey about your knowledge
    of issues related to artificial
    intelligence. The survey is anonymous.
    <a href="survey.html" target="_blank"> fill out the survey</a>. The survey
    results will be helpful in examining
    the degree of use of artificial
    intelligence in different age groups.</p>
